# NLP Using Deep Learning in Python – Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of the Udemy course **“Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Deep Learning in Python”** by *LazyProgrammer Inc.*  

The course covers modern NLP techniques, from traditional methods to deep learning approaches, using Python and popular libraries.

## 📚 Course Overview
The projects in this repo are based on topics covered throughout the course, including:

- Text preprocessing and vectorization  
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)  
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN, LSTM, GRU)  
- Attention mechanisms and Seq2Seq models  
- Transformer-based architectures (introductory concepts)  
- Sentiment analysis and text classification  
- Language modeling

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
The projects primarily use:

- **Python 3.x**  
- **NumPy, Pandas** – data handling  
- **Scikit-learn** – preprocessing & classical ML baselines  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – deep learning models  
- **Theano / PyTorch** (optional in some experiments)  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualization
